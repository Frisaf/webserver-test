Jag hade dock kunna önska lite bättre effekter, för på vissa ställen såg man hur det ganska tydligt var fejk, vilket man i och för sig förstår ändå, men det är ändå önskvärt att det ska se så realistiskt ut som möjligt. Sedan förstår jag givetvis att de har bekostat hela filmen själva, och att de därmed kanske har en lite mer tight budget.",

I cannot imagine all the work that they required, considering they didn't have CGI back then. It's gorey, but in a good way. You never know what to expect next, because before you know it, one you would never suspect is infected is indeed infected!",

At the start, I think we all know how it was going to end, or at least somewhat. They are, after all at the death row, however fun they try to make it. But even so, I had a tiny sliver of hope that it would somehow end well for them all.",
